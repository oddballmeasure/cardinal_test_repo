# Cardinal notes test application

This repository is a Docker Compose application with a FastAPI API, Redis
persistent storage, and a production React frontend served by Nginx. Redis is
the source of truth for notes and future dated diary entries; its append-only
file is stored in the named `redis_data` volume.

Start the full stack and inspect the published web and API ports:

```sh
docker compose up --build --wait
docker compose port web 80
docker compose port api 8000
```

The web container proxies `/api/*` to the API. Existing endpoints are:

```sh
curl http://localhost:<api-port>/health
curl -X POST http://localhost:<api-port>/notes \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"title":"Plan","tags":["work"]}'
curl http://localhost:<api-port>/notes
curl http://localhost:<api-port>/notes/1
```

`POST /notes` accepts a nonempty `title` and a list of nonempty string `tags`.
It returns the created note with a numeric ID. `GET /notes` returns notes in
creation order as JSON. `GET /notes/{id}` returns the saved note, or a JSON 404
error for an unknown or nonnumeric ID. API health depends on Redis being reachable.

Run the repository's container and browser E2E checks with:

```sh
python -m pip install 'playwright>=1.50,<2' 'pytest>=8,<10'
python -m playwright install chromium
python -m pytest -q tests
```

The tests build and start a unique Compose project, then remove its containers
and Redis volume. CI keeps the required check name `http-e2e` and builds all
images before running these tests.

The `deploy/` pair remains a fake-host validation fixture. Its script records
the configured host, and its health command checks that record and a fake host
readiness marker; it does not deploy to a production host.
